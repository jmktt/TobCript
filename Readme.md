## Text-Object Basic Cript Project

TOB is software that allows users to securely and efficiently encrypt and decrypt text. The following is a summary of how this program can work:

- Key Generation: The program generates a random cryptographic key that will be used to encrypt and decrypt the data.
- Encryption: The user enters the text they want to encrypt into the program, which uses the generated key to transform the text into an encrypted form.
- Decryption: When the user wants to access the original text, he enters the encrypted text into the program, which uses the same key to decode the text and return the original text.

This program is secure because the key is randomly generated and is used exclusively for encrypting and describing the data. This means that even if someone has access to the encrypted text, it cannot be read without the correct key. Furthermore, since the key is generated by the program, there is no need to share the key with others, which further enhances system security.
